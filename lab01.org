* TODO 8 duds and 1 armed bomb.
Some idiot forgot to disarm a bomb that is laid in the 'decomisioned' bomb pile.
Unfortunately the only way to tell which bomb is armed is to use a special weighing system.
To add insult to injury we don't know if the armed bomb weighs less or more on the system just that it weighs differently.
But there is yet another catch the weighing system only have two charges left, but it can weight any number of bombs at once.
Your job is to tell which 1 bomb out of the 9 bombs is armed while only using the weighing machine twice.

#+begin_note
  Begin by splitting the bombs into 3 groups of 3. Weigh two groups against each
other. If they are the same than you can assume the live bomb is in the other
group. If not, assuming the live bomb is heavier then the disarmed ones you know
the live bomb is in the heavier of the two. 
  Once you know which group it is in you can use the same meathod but instead of
groups with individual bombs. Place 2 on the scale and which ever is heavier 
that is the live one and if they are equal than the remaining bomb is the live
one.
  If you do not know if it is heavier or lighter this problem cannot be solved.

* TODO The BEAST
The Shoe Shack has made several top-dollar sales today. 
Using only the clues below, match each customer to their foot size, 
shoe brand and final purchase price.

No option in any category will ever be used more than once.  

1. The $185 pair was 4 sizes smaller than Natalie's pair.
2. The Cormano footwear was somewhat smaller than the Williford footwear.
3. The Schtillet footwear was somewhat larger than Marie's pair.
4. The $125 pair was somewhat larger than Marie's pair.
5. Lucia's pair wasn't made by Tinghill.
6. Of the $185 pair and the size 9 set, one was bought by Francine and the other was by Graffetz.
7. The $245 pair wasn't made by Tinghill.
8. The $260 pair was 2 sizes larger than Vanessa's pair.
9. The Williford footwear was 1 size smaller than Francine's pair.
10. The $125 pair was 2 sizes smaller than Ruth's pair.
11. The $215 pair was 5 sizes smaller than the $170 pair.
12. The $185 pair was 2 sizes smaller than Lucia's pair.
13. The Schtillet footwear was either Ruth's pair or the size 5 set.
14. The Abbott Hill footwear was 5 sizes larger than the $215 pair.
15. The Williford footwear was 1 size smaller than the $245 pair.

In 01-ponder do every third exercise. 
That is if you start at the first or 1st then you need to do 4th,
but if you start at 3rd then you need to do the 6th.

:HINT:
  - Hint :: The exercise could be more explicitly stated as: Provide
            justification for the equivalence of the logical and set operation
            description (columns 3 and 2) for each set (column 1) in the table.
            So, use wording like \ldquo{}Set A is justified as the union of numbered
            regions 4, 5, 7 and 6, because \dots\rdquo.
:END:
#+end_note
#+begin_info
  Set A is justified because the logic discription is the binary equivalants of 
the numbers. If true = 1 and false = 0 than we get 100, 101, 111, 110.
  Set B is justified for the same reason but with different numbers. If true = 1
and false = 0 than we get 010, 011, 111, 110.
  Set C is justified for the same reason as the first two. If true = 1 and false
= 0 than we get 001, 011, 101, 111.

  2. The set of words that are in A *and* B; call this set *D*.
  3. The subset of set *C* of words that start with \lsquo{}v\rsquo.

  5. The subset of set *C* of words that start with \lsquo{}v\rsquo and end with \lsquo{}r\rsquo.
  6. The subset of set *D* of words that have six letters.

A more Brother Neff-like assignment, with a Brother Benning twist!

Please Complete all Problems and Puzzles including the 'optional ones', but skipping the exercises.
I would recommend working together.  As always I will give out hints
periodically.

(NOTE:I would keep all your exercises/problems/puzzles you do, if you
take DM 2, you may find these extreeeeeeeeeemly helpful, or not)
