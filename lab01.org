* TODO 8 duds and 1 armed bomb.
Some idiot forgot to disarm a bomb that is laid in the 'decomisioned' bomb pile.
Unfortunately the only way to tell which bomb is armed is to use a special weighing system.
To add insult to injury we don't know if the armed bomb weighs less or more on the system just that it weighs differently.
But there is yet another catch the weighing system only have two charges left, but it can weight any number of bombs at once.
Your job is to tell which 1 bomb out of the 9 bombs is armed while only using the weighing machine twice.

#+begin_note
  Begin by splitting the bombs into 3 groups of 3. Weigh two groups against each
other. If they are the same than you can assume the live bomb is in the other
group. If not, assuming the live bomb is heavier then the disarmed ones you know
the live bomb is in the heavier of the two. 
  Once you know which group it is in you can use the same meathod but instead of
groups with individual bombs. Place 2 on the scale and which ever is heavier 
that is the live one and if they are equal than the remaining bomb is the live
one.
  If you do not know if it is heavier or lighter this problem cannot be solved.
